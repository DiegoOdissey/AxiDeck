# TrussiApp

A custom WinUI application that controls Trussi devices (which are currently not for sale, obviously). Every device appears as a card in the home screen, connected devices will be automatically recognized and marked with a green dot. Each device can be highly customized, and it's possible to assign for each button a determined action. Right now the buttons have:

- **Media Control**: Control media playback like videos and music, for example Previous, Pause/Play and Next.
- **Open Application**: Open an .exe file
- **Shortcut**: Execute a keyboard shortcut combination (Alt + F4, Shift + F5, etc...)
- **Open website**: Open a website with the OS's default browser, given the link.

Knob buttons have different options:
- **Main volume**: The knob will control Windows volume
- *Application volume*: **Yet to implement**, the knob will control a specific process name (which can be used to control Discord's volume, Gaming, Browser, etc...)

Knobs featuring a press button have also the normal buttons options.

Devices featuring screens (like the AxiDeck) have an option to show a label for each button on said screen.

## AxiDeck Firmware

The AxiDeck firmware is written for **Arduino Nano**. It currently features:

- Serial handshake (`CONNECT`)
- Current time syncronization
- Currert song (Spotify/Apple Music/Youtube) synchronization, which appears on Screen #1 (Left)
- Knob and button event reporting back to the host
- OLED screen managing with TCA multiplexer

The firmware can be flashed with the Arduino IDE.

### External libraries required:
- Wire
- Adafuit_GFX
- Adafruit_SSD1306
